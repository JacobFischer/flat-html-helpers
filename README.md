# Flat HTML Helpers

This is a utility library primarily focused around quick and dirty HTML edits from flat sources, such as [Markdown].

When you parse a markdown file that follows the spec, often times the output HTML is very flat and lacking. This
library is a middle man to help format and generally improve the HTML markup for use on websites.

**NOTE**: This is **not** a Markdown parser. Instead you can parse your markdown with whatever your favorite parser
is (I like [marked]), then through the generated HTML trough the util function(s) here.
